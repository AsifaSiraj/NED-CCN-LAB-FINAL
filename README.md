# NED-CCN-LAB-FINAL
Description:
Final project for the Computer Communication Networks (CCN) Lab at NED University. This lab simulation demonstrates the configuration and implementation of VLAN, RIP, LACP, and DHCP protocols using Huawei's eNSP (Enterprise Network Simulation Platform). The project showcases how these network services interact in a multi-switch, multi-router topology for efficient and dynamic network communication.

Features:

VLAN segmentation for logical grouping of devices

RIP (Routing Information Protocol) for dynamic routing between routers

LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol) for bandwidth optimization and redundancy

DHCP server setup for automatic IP address assignment

Tools Used:

Huawei eNSP

Virtual PCs and network devices

Command-line interface for configuration

Educational Objective:
To understand and implement core networking protocols in a virtual enterprise network setup and analyze their behavior in a simulated environment.
